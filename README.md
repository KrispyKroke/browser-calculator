# In-Browser Calculator
By Jared Kroke

## Description
This was a self-driven project (outside of an academic/work setting) I started to practice some of my skills associated with React, Node.js, Redux/Sagas, and SQL.  I created an interactive calculator with the added feature of a calculator history display.  The user can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  They can also manipulate decimal numbers, negate numbers, and get percent values.

The calculation history display can be toggled from shown to hidden, and history can be cleared at the click of a button.  This also wipes the history on the back-end as well.

I enjoyed working on this project, and plan on tackling other challenges now that this has been completed.  I hope that you enjoy what I have created here.
